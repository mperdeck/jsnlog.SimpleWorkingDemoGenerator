Do not create a test project that targets .Net 4.0. Here is why.

JSNLog has a dependency on the package
 <dependency id="Microsoft.Bcl.Async" version="1.0.168" />
 
This package lets you use async/await in environments that do not have .Net 4.5 or higher installed.
In projects that target .Net 4.0, it installs a number of references, such as System.Runtime.
In projects that target .Net 4.5 or higher, that doesn't happen - because there assemblies such as System.Runtime are part of .Net itself (in the GAC).

Problem is that if you install Microsoft.Bcl.Async in a project that targets 4.0, whilst running in an evnironment that has .net 4.5+, things get confused.
It will throw an exception, because now System.Runtime is defined in 2 places - via Microsoft.Bcl.Async and in the framework itself.

So the base issue is that Microsoft.Bcl.Async assumes that the target .net version of the project is the same as the .net version of the environment.

This problem plays with all versions of JSNLog, including 2.17.0.
