NuGet Package Restore
---------------------
To reduce download times, this solution uses NuGet Package Restore. This means that when you download the solution from Github, it does not contain the packages folder. Then when you build the solution, Visual Studio automatically loads the packages from NuGet.

This all happens automatically if you use NuGet version 2.7 or higher. However, if you use NuGet 2.0-2.6, you'll need to give consent. See http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-restore#Package_Restore_Consent
